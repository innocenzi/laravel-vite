# Quick start

:::info Are you using <a href="https://inertiajs.com">Inertia</a>?
There is an Inertia preset for a fast and easy installation. You can check our [Inertia guide](/guide/extra-topics/inertia).
:::

## Installation in a fresh project

The recommended and the easiest approach to get started with Laravel Vite is to use the preset. It's a single command that will:

- Delete `resources/js` and create `resources/scripts`
- Delete `webpack.mix.js` and remove the dependency to `laravel-mix`
- Add development dependencies on `vite` and `vite-plugin-laravel`
- Update `package.json`'s scripts to use Vite
- Add a dependency on `innocenzi/laravel-vite`
- Create a `vite.config.ts` configuration file
- Add a call to the `@vite` directive in `welcome.blade.php`

To apply the preset, run the following command:

```sh
> npx @preset/cli apply laravel:vite
```

:::tip What next?
Everything will be up and ready. You can open your `resources/scripts/main.ts` file and start from there.

## Installation in an existing project

### Before starting

Vite can replace Webpack in existing projects, but some changes will be necessary. For instance, here is two common gotchas:

- Vite explicitly requires that all Vue single-file components imports include the `.vue` in the path.
- Vite is ESM-based, so you should use `import` instead of `require`.

There are a handful more differences between the two that could make your existing application build to fail, especially when coming from Webpack 4, which had some Node polyfills. When encountering issues, we recommend asking in the [Vite Discord](https://chat.vitejs.dev)'s `#help` or `#laravel` channels.

### Initial setup

With that in mind, you can start replacing Mix. First, you can delete your `webpack.mix.js` and remove the dependency on `laravel-mix`. Then, you need to require both the PHP package and Vite plugin.

```sh
# Remove Mix
> rm webpack.mix.js
> npm remove laravel-mix

# Require the packages
> composer require "innocenzi/laravel-vite:0.2.*"
> npm i -D vite vite-plugin-laravel
```

Vite's configuration resides in a `vite.config.ts` file at the root of your project. Go ahead and create it, and import `vite-plugin-laravel`.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'
import laravel from 'laravel-vite-plugin'

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [
		vue(),
		laravel()
	]
})
```

The main configuration is defined in `config/vite.php`, which the Vite plugin reads in order to infer the configuration needed to integrate with Laravel. To configure Vite, publish its configuration:

```sh
> php artisan vendor:publish --tag=vite-config
```

### Matching the Mix config

#### Loaders

If you were using any Webpack loader for TypeScript, Vue, PostCSS, SASS, Stylus... you can safely remove them. Vite handles them without additional configuration. 

Except for PostCSS, you do need to install the CSS pre-processors you are using, though. You can learn more about this on the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css-pre-processors).

#### Input files

The equivalent of Mix's `.js(input, output)` is `config/vite.php`'s `entrypoints`. For instance, if you had this in your Mix configuration:

```js
mix.js('resources/js/app.js', 'public/js')
    .postCss('resources/css/app.css', 'public/css');
```

You should use the following `config/vite.php` configuration:

```php
<?php

return [
  // ...

  'configs' => [
    'default' => [
        'entrypoints' => [
            'paths' => [
                'resources/js/app.js',
                'resources/css/app.css',
            ],
        ],

      // ...
    ],
  ],
];
```

:::tip No output option
You probably noticed the lack of an "output" option in the Vite configuration. That's because Vite builds everything in the configured `build` directory, so you don't need to worry about the paths of your assets.
