# Getting started

## Installation

### Using the preset

This is the recommended and the easiest approach. The [preset](https://github.com/laravel-presets/vite) can be applied with a single command, without prior installation.

To use it, run the following command at the root of your project:

```bash
npx apply laravel:vite
```

The preset may take a while to be applied, because it will update your dependencies. If you'd rather update them manually, you may use the `--no-install` flag.

Additionally, it defaults to installing Vue 3. If you don't want that, you may use the `--no-vue` flag.

:::warning Note for Mac users
You will likely get an error because `apply` is NOT a valid command on your system. You need to either install `apply` globally with `npm i -g apply`, or use the `--ignore-existing` flag.
:::

The preset will:

- Delete `resources/js` and create `resources/scripts`
- Delete `webpack.mix.js` and remove the dependency to `laravel-mix`
- Add development dependencies on `vite` and `laravel-vite` and update `package.json`'s scripts
- Add a dependency on [`innocenzi/laravel-vite`](https://github.com/innocenzi/laravel-vite)
- Create a `vite.config.ts` configuration file
- Add a call to the `@vite` directive in `welcome.blade.php`

### Manually

If you'd rather install Vite manually, you can follow these steps.

First, you need to remove Laravel Mix. You can do that by deleting `webpack.mix.js` and removing the dependency on `laravel-mix`. Then, you need to require both the PHP and the Node packages.

```bash
# Remove Mix
rm webpack.mix.js
yarn remove laravel-mix

# Require the packages
composer require innocenzi/laravel-vite
yarn add vite laravel-vite --dev
```

Vite is configured via a `vite.config.ts` file at the root of your project. Laravel Vite intervenes at this step to integrate with Laravel. For more information about that, read the [configuration documentation](/guide/configuration).

```ts
// vite.config.ts
export { default } from "laravel-vite";
```

Finally, edit your `package.json` file's `scripts` property:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "serve": "vite preview"
}
```
