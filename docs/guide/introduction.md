# Introduction

## Scope

This project aims to integrate [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) as much as possible with Laravel. It is designed to be a complete replacement for [Laravel Mix](https://laravel-mix.com), which is based on Webpack.

> To learn the benefits of using Vite, refer to [its documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/introduction.html#the-problem).
